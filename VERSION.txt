%V1.0.0 - Initial Release
	Initial release includes the following primary features...
		Time invariant heat input
		Stress analysis
		Thermal analysis
		Single phase materials
V1.0.1 - Fixed bug, added 'ARL'	
V1.0.2 - Added Parapower Manual, version 1	

V1.1.0 - Adding PCM

V2.0.0 - Added transient and PCM

V3.0.0 - Complete GUI rewrite
         Core parapowerthermal rewritten to be directionally agnostic
		 Core parapowerthermal rewritten to be better vectorized
		 FormModel and Visualize intermediary functions added to ease model build by script
		 MaterialDatabase added to replace matlibfun
		 Voids do not quite work yet.
V3.1.0 - Refined GUI
		 Major rewrite of visualization with significant speed improvement
V3.2.0 - Converting to material objects.  
         Main analysis rewite into an object to support SimuLink usage
V3.2.2 - Material Library code rewritten as object and incorporated into main code
V3.2.4 - Modified material library code to optimize performance
V3.2.5 - Materials melt fraction is now initialized to be consistent with
              its starting temperature
         Visualizes modified so that if min(plotstate)=max(plotstate) the
              color scale is set to [plotstate(1) Inf]. This ensure it
              does not result in [-1 1] for all melt fractions @ 0
         Added test case for material initialization
VX.X.X - Parameterization added (both vector and scalar).  Not implemented for table defined Q's yet
		 Repeated waveforms based on tables implemented with a checkbox in the GUI and 
			  flagged by the last row of tabled defined Q as [-inf, -inf]
		 Testcases updated for PPTCM
V4.0.0 - Initial Open Source Approval
		 

Features to Add
1. Enable 'stop' button on GUI
3. Ensure potting material in testmodelcase structure is 0
