Features to Add
-------------------
200629 - Checkboxes for results are ignored for 2d plots.

Enable 'stop' button on GUI
Prettify results plots
Add total mass output

Object Oriented Material Matrix Construction:
    State Structure
        StateMatrix.Desc{i} = 'Melt Fraction', 'Temperature', 'Stress' -> Easily indexable by strcmpi
        StateMatrix.Value(i, Xindex, Yindex, Zindex, t_index) -> Vectorized extraction of any state of state at any time or state at any location & time
    Functions in each material:
        State Initialization
            Input: Current State, X_index, Y_index, Z_index, X_length, Y_length, Z_length
            Output: StateMatrix for given X_index, Y_index, Z_index
        Fill A Matrix
Include non-directional stress model
Custom timesteps
User Manual
Enable visualize by feature not material
Add option for feature plot to plot selected features only
Results object
	include peak plots
Post Processing App
	Add optional X-axis vectors (such as time)
Solver
	Melt residuals
	option for adaptive steps
Enable h-infinity for constant temperature BC
Visualize
	Check speed impact of Q legend
	

Items Completed.
------------------
Add button to simply do XY plot so you don't have to rerun analysis.
Save profile w/o results
Melt fraction issues
Reduce # of decimals on colorbars
In 'visualize' click different materials 'on' and 'off'
Double clicking on figure to load is not working right for Lauren...not valid functionality.
Plot state on detailed visual output doesn't match GUI time step (off by 1)
Add notice of finished save in status window.
Clarify Materials database save
Only redraw when 'redraw' is pressed not on all inits
Delete results on GUI clear
Save Feature descriptors
Ensure that Load/Save Profile includes proper material information
Q is NaN
Change to mm
Make line and point elements material type 0
Visualization, materials sometimes only cover 1/2 the colorbar
Address the defined Q for features that are overwritten
Show full hexahedral domain in green outline or equiv
Enable voids in solution
Add 'Cancel' button to table view for Q
In feature table add buttons to insert/move up/move down
Visualization, space starts at 0
Change sense of Q in visualize to match model
Add feature descriptor
Ensure Q as a table with repeated times works correctly.
Error trap if time in Q table is not increasing.
Split X and Y divisions into separate columns
Add 'Cancel' button to mat database
Re-enable stress analysis - there's now a stress function to be called.
Static Analysis is broken
Stress Model Additions:
    Must include substrate feature for PPTCM and then map into MI number of layers
        And ensure underlying assumptions are met.  Kick out error if assumptinos are violated
